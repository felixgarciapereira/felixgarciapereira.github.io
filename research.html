          <h2 style="text-align: center;">OBSERVING SURFACE AND SUBSURFACE CLIMATE VARIABILITY IN MOUNTAIN AREAS</h2>
          <img src="ext_material/images/papers/VEGAetal-20-atm_webpage.png" alt="image" width="800" height=auto>
          <p>Mountain areas are especially sensitive to the effects of climate change. Rising temperatures and changes in the seasonal and spatial distribution of precipitation are causing shifts in snow cover, vegetation zones, wildlife, and soils, among other aspects. Observing and understanding the effects of climate change on mountain ecosystems is, therefore, a key area of scientific interest. However, the rugged and inaccessible terrain, harsh environmental conditions, and general lack of infrastructure in these regions make it extremely difficult to monitor and study the climate and the effects of climate change on them.</p>

          <p>The monitoring network GuMNet (<a href="https://www.ucm.es/gumnet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Guadarrama Monitoring Network</a>) was established as an interinstitutional initiative (CEI, Ciemat, AEMET, PNSG, PN, CSIC-IGEO) with the objective of monitoring and studying the mid- and high-altitude climate in the Sierra de Guadarrama region, located in the center of the Iberian Peninsula. The network consists of 10 stations situated between 900 and 2200 meters above sea level, measuring atmospheric variables (temperature, precipitation, wind speed, etc.) and soil variables (soil temperature and moisture). <a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/atmos11090985" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vegas et al. (2020)</a> analyzes regional 2 m air temperature variability and its response to climate change in recent decades. To do so, observed temperature series from GuMNet and AEMET are compared with three simulations performed with the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) at three different resolutions: 9, 3, and 1 km. The period of simulation in the three cases is 2000-2018. Figure 1 shows the temporal and spatial distribution of temperature trends in the area of Sierra de Guadarrama as portrayed by the observational sites and WRF. The temporal evolution of temperature variability shows a great consistency between the different sites and WRF (Fig. 1a), as shown by coordinated colder and warmer periods. Annual temperature trends for different stations in Sierra de Guadarrama and its surroundings are significant (p < 0.05, red labels in Fig. 1a), with values ranging from 0.19 to 0.35 degC/decade. Temperature trend values are smaller for the longest observational time series, which suggests that the warming has accelerated in the recent decades. By contrast, WRF shows regional warming but non-significant. The regional distribution of trends in 2000-2018 (Fig. 1a) shows a quite uniform warming of around 0.2-0.3 degC/decade, with slightly higher values in the southern foothills of the Sierra. In conclusion, <a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/atmos11090985" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vegas et al. (2020)</a> reports a significant and spatially consistent warming in Sierra de Guadarrama of about 0.3 degC/decade in the recent decades, value that exceeds global mean temperature trend values (0.18 degC/decade in 1973-2022; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-023-01061-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samset et al., 2023</a>). </p>

          <p><a href="https://soil.copernicus.org/articles/10/1/2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">García-Pereira et al. (2024)</a> focuses on analyzing the thermodynamic structure of the soil at various locations in the mountain range, using data from four GuMNet stations (Cotos, CTS; Hoyas, HYS; Raso del Pino I, RSI; Herrería, HRR) and two stations from AEMET’s network (Puerto de Navacerrada, NVC; Segovia, SGV; Fig. 2a). GuMNet stations have relatively short series (2015-2021) of trench soil temperature and moisture data to a depth of 1 meter (TRCH, Fig. 2b) and borehole temperature data (BRH, Fig. 2c,d) to a depth of 20 meters, whereas AEMET stations provide comparatively longer series (1989-2018) but only of TRCH temperature. An assessment of the coupling between air and ground surface temperatures showed that soil insulation due to snow cover is the main source of seasonal decoupling, especially relevant in winter at high-altitude sites. The vertical propagation of temperature underground was characterized by assuming that heat transport occurs purely through conduction, disregarding transport by advection or radiation. Apparent thermal diffusivity values were obtained based on the attenuation of amplitude and phase shift of the annual cycle with depth. This methodology was also extended to analyze attenuation across the entire temperature spectral domain, which allowed for an evaluation of temporal changes in thermal diffusivity near the soil surface. For deep profiles, apparent thermal diffusivity values range from 1 to 1.4 m²/s, consistent with values for gneiss and granite, the main bedrock components in the Sierra de Guadarrama. However, thermal diffusivity is lower and more heterogeneous in soil layers closer to the surface (0.4–0.8 m²/s). An increase in diffusivity with depth was observed, generally greater at the soil-to-bedrock transition, at a depth of 4–8 meters. In this way, changes in vertical thermal diffusivity allow for the identification of variations in the composition of materials within the column. Additionally, the spectral method results suggest that temporal changes in thermal diffusivity near the surface are related to changes in soil moisture content, making it a potential tool for obtaining information on soil drought and the availability of water resources based on soil temperature data.</p>

          <h2 style="text-align: center;">LAND HEAT UPTAKE AND THE THE TERRESTRIAL HEAT INVENTORY</h2>
        <div class="research-cont1">

          <p>Greenhouse gas emissions resulting from human activities have raised their atmospheric concentrations to record levels in the past one million years. Last spring, the Mauna Loa Observatory (Hawaii) recorded, for the first time, more than 430 ppm of CO₂, setting a new record since direct measurements began. This intensification of the greenhouse effect, of anthropogenic origin, is driving an atmospheric warming unprecedented over at least the last two millennia, and likely since the last interglacial maximum around 120,000 years ago. This warming stems from a positive planetary energy imbalance, meaning that the Earth now absorbs more solar energy than it emits back to space, the latter being reduced by the rising concentration of greenhouse gases. The most recent estimates place this imbalance at 0.76 W/m² for 2006–2020 and 0.48 W/m² for 1971–2020, suggesting an acceleration in Earth’s energy uptake. However, it is not only the atmosphere that is warming in response to this imbalance; all components of the Earth’s climate system are gaining and storing energy, including the subsurface. "Where does the energy go?" has been a longstanding question in climate science whose understanding has implications for climate dynamics, ocean circulation, and land-atmosphere interaction.</p>

          <p>Recent observational estimates identify the ocean as the main contributor to the Earth’s heat inventory, having absorbed at least 90 % of the energy imbalance over the past five decades. The subsurface is the second most important energy sink, with a relative contribution of about 5 %. Observational estimates of land heat uptake (or ground heat storage) come from borehole reconstructions, ground heat flux & subsurface temperature reconstructions derived from temperature profiles recorded at sparse locations and specific logging dates. To obtain a complete picture of land heat uptake in both time and space, Earth System Models (ESMs) should provide a complementary source of information. However, current ESMs are unable to reproduce observational estimates, underestimating the role of the subsurface at around 2 %. This underestimate arises from imposing zero-flux bottom boundary conditions that are too shallow, typically above 10 m, when solving subsurface heat transfer.  </p>

          <p> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2021GL094273" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steinert et al. (2021)</a> demonstrates, using a combined numerical–analytical approach, that an LSM depth of at least 170 m is required to correctly represent the propagation of ground-surface temperature trends for the period 1850–2100. Deepening the LSM depth results in a reduction of subsurface temperature trends with warming, and an increase in land heat uptake. However, ground surface temperatures do not respond to changes in the LSM depth. This fact was demonstrated by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1175/JHM-D-21-0024.1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">González-Rouco et al. (2021)</a> using standalone LSM simulations with increasingly deeper representations of the bottom boundary condition, from 10 m to 1400 m. <a href="https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-15-547-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">García-Pereira et al. (2024)</a> confirm this surprising result by performing the first fully-coupled ESM simulation of the Common Era (0-2100) with a very deep LSM (bottom boundary at 1400 m). As ground surface temperature is irresponsive to changes in the LSM depth, any surface temperature dataset can be used as a boundary condition to drive a half-infinite heat-conduction forward model—i.e., one without a bottom boundary condition—and yield unbiased estimates of land heat uptake. <a href="https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-15-547-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">García-Pereira et al. (2024)</a> show the methodology is robust to recover corrected values of land heat uptake. Applying this methodology to gridded meteorological observations, reanalyses, and CMIP6 ESM simulations, <a href="https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-15-547-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">García-Pereira et al. (2024)</a> provide a catalogue of land heat uptake estimates of the industrial period. Land heat uptake values in 1971-2018, of 10-16 ZJ, are much closer to observational estimates than those produced by CMIP6 models.  </p>

          <p>Global permafrost regions are undergoing significant changes due to global warming, whose assessments often rely on permafrost extent estimates derived from climate model simulations. These assessments employ a range of definitions for the presence of permafrost, leading to inconsistencies in the calculation of permafrost area. Here, we present permafrost area calculations using 10 different definitions for detecting permafrost presence based on either ground thermodynamics, soil hydrology, or air-ground coupling from an ensemble of 32 Earth system models. We find that variations between permafrost-presence definitions result in substantial differences of up to 18 million km2, where any given model could both over- or underestimate the present-day permafrost area. Ground-thermodynamic-based definitions are, on average, comparable with observations but are subject to a large inter-model spread. The associated uncertainty of permafrost area estimates is reduced in definitions based on ground-air coupling. However, their representation of permafrost area strongly depends on how each model represents the ground-air coupling processes. The definition-based spread in permafrost area can affect estimates of permafrost-related impacts and feedbacks, such as quantifying permafrost carbon changes. For instance, the definition spread in permafrost area estimates can lead to differences in simulated permafrost-area soil carbon changes of up to 28%. We therefore emphasize the importance of consistent and well-justified permafrost-presence definitions for robust projections and accurate assessments of permafrost from climate model outputs.</p>
