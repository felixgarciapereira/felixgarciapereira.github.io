          <h2>OBSERVING SURFACE AND SUBSURFACE CLIMATE VARIABILITY IN MOUNTAIN AREAS</h2>
          <img src="ext_material/images/papers/VEGAetal-20-atm_webpage.png" alt="image" width="800" height=auto>
          <p>Mountain areas are especially sensitive to the effects of climate change. Rising temperatures and changes in the seasonal and spatial distribution of precipitation are causing shifts in snow cover, vegetation zones, wildlife, and soils, among other aspects. Observing and understanding the effects of climate change on mountain ecosystems is, therefore, a key area of scientific interest. However, the rugged and inaccessible terrain, harsh environmental conditions, and general lack of infrastructure in these regions make it extremely difficult to monitor and study the climate and the effects of climate change on them.</p>

          <p>The monitoring network GuMNet (Guadarrama Monitoring Network, <a href="https://www.ucm.es/gumnet/">) was established as an interinstitutional initiative (CEI, Ciemat, AEMET, PNSG, PN, CSIC-IGEO) with the objective of monitoring and studying the mid- and high-altitude climate in the Sierra de Guadarrama region, located in the center of the Iberian Peninsula. The network consists of 10 stations situated between 900 and 2200 meters above sea level, measuring atmospheric variables (temperature, precipitation, wind speed, etc.) and soil variables (soil temperature and moisture). Vegas et al. (2020) analyzes regional variability in air temperature and its response to climate change. García-Pereira et al. (2024) focuses on analyzing the thermodynamic structure of the soil at various locations in the mountain range, using data from four GuMNet stations (Cotos, CTS; Hoyas, HYS; Raso del Pino I, RSI; Herrería, HRR) and two stations from AEMET’s network (Puerto de Navacerrada, NVC; Segovia, SGV; Fig. 2a). GuMNet stations have relatively short series (2015-2021) of trench soil temperature and moisture data to a depth of 1 meter (TRCH, Fig. 2b) and borehole temperature data (BRH, Fig. 2c,d) to a depth of 20 meters, whereas AEMET stations provide comparatively longer series (1989-2018) but only of TRCH temperature.</p>

          <p>An assessment of the coupling between air and ground surface temperatures showed that soil insulation due to snow cover is the main source of seasonal decoupling, especially relevant in winter at high-altitude sites. The vertical propagation of temperature underground was characterized by assuming that heat transport occurs purely through conduction, disregarding transport by advection or radiation. Apparent thermal diffusivity values were obtained based on the attenuation of amplitude and phase shift of the annual cycle with depth. This methodology was also extended to analyze attenuation across the entire temperature spectral domain, which allowed for an evaluation of temporal changes in thermal diffusivity near the soil surface. For deep profiles, apparent thermal diffusivity values range from 1 to 1.4 m²/s, consistent with values for gneiss and granite, the main bedrock components in the Sierra de Guadarrama. However, thermal diffusivity is lower and more heterogeneous in soil layers closer to the surface (0.4–0.8 m²/s). An increase in diffusivity with depth was observed, generally greater at the soil-to-bedrock transition, at a depth of 4–8 meters. In this way, changes in vertical thermal diffusivity allow for the identification of variations in the composition of materials within the column. Additionally, the spectral method results suggest that temporal changes in thermal diffusivity near the surface are related to changes in soil moisture content, making it a potential tool for obtaining information on soil drought and the availability of water resources based on soil temperature data.</p>

          <img src="images/research_NJS_2023.png" alt="image" width="800" height=auto>
          <p>Global permafrost regions are undergoing significant changes due to global warming, whose assessments often rely on permafrost extent estimates derived from climate model simulations. These assessments employ a range of definitions for the presence of permafrost, leading to inconsistencies in the calculation of permafrost area. Here, we present permafrost area calculations using 10 different definitions for detecting permafrost presence based on either ground thermodynamics, soil hydrology, or air-ground coupling from an ensemble of 32 Earth system models. We find that variations between permafrost-presence definitions result in substantial differences of up to 18 million km2, where any given model could both over- or underestimate the present-day permafrost area. Ground-thermodynamic-based definitions are, on average, comparable with observations but are subject to a large inter-model spread. The associated uncertainty of permafrost area estimates is reduced in definitions based on ground-air coupling. However, their representation of permafrost area strongly depends on how each model represents the ground-air coupling processes. The definition-based spread in permafrost area can affect estimates of permafrost-related impacts and feedbacks, such as quantifying permafrost carbon changes. For instance, the definition spread in permafrost area estimates can lead to differences in simulated permafrost-area soil carbon changes of up to 28%. We therefore emphasize the importance of consistent and well-justified permafrost-presence definitions for robust projections and accurate assessments of permafrost from climate model outputs.</p>
